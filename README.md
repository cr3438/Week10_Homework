The goal of this project is to explore whether a driver’s starting grid position predicts the average number of race points they get, and how this relationship changes depending on the specific race circuit.

The circuits included are:
1. Circuit de Monaco (Monaco Grand Prix)  
2. Autódromo José Carlos Pace (Brazilian Grand Prix)
3. Baku City CircuitV(Azerbaijan Grand Prix)
4. Silverstone Circuit (British Grand Prix)
5. Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (Belgian Grand Prix)

Summary
1. Downloads the TidyTuesday F1 data directly from GitHub
2. Merges race, results, and circuit tables
3. Filter seasons (2015–2021)
4. Code average race points by starting grid position and circuit
5. A line plot showing how starting position affects points across the circuits
