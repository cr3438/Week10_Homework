This repository analyzes how Formula 1 starting grid position corrolates to race points, and how this relationship changes by circuit, using the TidyTuesday F1 dataset.

The goal of this project is to explore whether a driver’s starting grid position predicts the average number of race points they get, and how this relationship changes depending on the specific race circuit.

The circuits included in this analysis are:
Circuit de Monaco (Monaco Grand Prix)  
Autódromo José Carlos Pace (Brazilian Grand Prix)  
Baku City CircuitV(Azerbaijan Grand Prix)  
Silverstone Circuit (British Grand Prix)  
Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (Belgian Grand Prix)
